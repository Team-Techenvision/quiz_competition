When you return to the same techEnvision website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the techEnvision features that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
